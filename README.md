# vertex-plotting
Example creating 2 and 3D plots of a vertex model using POV-Ray and Python.

Vertex Model was written in Python 3 and used in the publication of [Durney et. al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1478-3975/abfa69/meta). 

Plotting uses the ray tracing software [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) which interfaces with Python through [Vapory](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory).

To use: 
1. [Install POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/download/)
2. [Install Vapory](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory)
3. [Install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)

The following setup has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04LTS with Python 3.
